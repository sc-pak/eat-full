# eat-full
Covid-19 effectively shutdown the public school system in most areas around the US. Students in Duluth Middle School who depended on free or reduced lunches are no longer able to expect a meal during lunch time as long as schools are closed. This project serves to help connect community sponsors and families to better fill that need.

Currently there are no ideas or plans for this project. If you have an idea, append to the list below in similar format as the first entry:
